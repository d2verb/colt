## Scope
Colt lang doesn't have global scope and only has function scope (not like c lang, having block scope).
All variable definitions must be placed on the top of the function body.

## Type
Colt lang only has one primitive type, (32-bit signed)int. So we don't have to do type check any more.

## Function Signature
We must check the number of arguments in function calls.
If the number of arguments doesn't match the number of parameters of the called function, we emit error message.

## Identifier re-definition
Colt lang dosn't allow re-definition.

## Entry point
Colt lang assume the Main() function is its entry point.
So If the program doesn't have Main() function, we emit error message.

## The order of function definitions
Colt lang is function-definition-order-independent langauge.
So we can assume all function prototypes are already on the top of the program.
